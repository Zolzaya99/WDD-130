      [We are always told that a picture is worth a thousand words. I believe 
      that a picture is more meaningful and priceless than any amount of words. 
      I have a personal belief that pictures are not only a look into the past, 
      but are doors that lead our hearts into a nostalgic journey to our most 
      cherished memories. My main focus is to ensure that your pictures not 
      only ook amazing but also that you have an enjoyable experience during the 
      photo shoot as well. I always ensure that the time you spent is never 
      wasted and that your photos are of the utmost highest quality that is 
      available today. Each image will be specially edited and crafted to fit 
      your desires. These memories will be sent out to you in a quick and timely 
      fashion that won't leave you wondering where your pictures are.]

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      [Welcome to Zolzaya's Photography website. I am currently a student at 
      BYU-Idaho majoring in Web Design and Development. Interesting facts about 
      me I am from Mongolia. I've recently married the love of my life 5 months 
      ago. My absolute two favorite things to do in my free time are cooking at 
      home and exploring nature like camping, hiking, kayaking, etc. Though I am 
      not majoring in photography, I took photography classes in high school and 
      in college. I have been doing photography since I was a sophomore in high 
      school, and this is my 5th year of experience in photography. I plan to 
      continue following my passion to capture great memories for others. I absolutely 
      love being able to record moments that my clients can look back and value 
      throughout their lives. More than anything, I am fully committed to capturing 
      moments that give you joy and put a smile on your face. So, please don't hesitate
      to reach out and ask if you have any questions.]

    <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
      [Here you can see my personal portfolio. I have a variety of images for 
      you to look at and see what style you like the most. Based on the style 
      or multiple styles you choose from my portfolio, we can come up with 
      a plan and price range based on those calculations. Although I have 
      specific styles and choices, I am open to trying new things and 
      experimenting with new ideas in order to meet your photography needs. 
      When selecting a photoshoot style from my portfolio, it is important 
      to keep in mind that with each choice you make, you must choose a date 
      and time that corresponds with my schedule. For example, if you choose 
      to do a wedding photo shoot on your special day and someone else has 
      already picked that day for me to shoot their wedding, I can not adjust 
      that day to fit your schedule. So it is important to always remember when 
      you are free and how that lines up with when I'm available.]
